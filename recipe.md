How to Bake Red Velvet Cake......


step 1. First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C). Next let's make our cake batter. Start by creaming butter your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer to do this.

step 2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix, once that egg completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

step 3. Now we add in cocoa powder. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout the whole process we don't want to over mix, just until things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

step 4. Now add in our vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar.If you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablesppon of lemon juice or vinegarand then leave it for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

step 5. Now we add in oil to the buttermilk mixture.Next add in about 2 to 2 1/2 Tablespoons of red food colouring liquid.Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red colour. Set that mixture aside for now.

step 6. Next we will add baking salt and baking soda to flour. You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour mixture, cake flour tends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose flour works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

step 7. We will add half of our food colouring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture, then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

step 8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust then with cocoa powder or flour and I always add a little round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom tooas an added precaution,and my nonstick pans are great, but I like to over-it. Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, which helps prevent air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, etc. But it won't effect the taste of the cake at all! So don't worry about it. Now bake the cake for 25-30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step 9. Now after the baking of cake take the cake out of the oven and leave it to coolin their pans for about 10 minutes. After that we can remove the parchment paper and from the pan and let it dry, cool completely.After that place the cake in fridge and let them chill, which helps in frosting.

step 10. Well now it is time to make our frosting , we still be using just a few ingredients, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and powderd sugar (confectioner's sugar).

step 11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a bowl and mix with a hand mixer until it becomes smooth usually takes a few minutes. Then slowly incorporate all of the powderd sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want. Next just remove the beaters. Frosting is ready. At this point if the frosting is still too runny add more powderd sugar, or just chill it for about 30 minutes before frosting the cake.

step 12. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. Then gently apply it to your cake sides and on top. You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving.

NOW THE RED VELVET CAKE IS READY.... IT'S TIME TO EAT AND ENJOY...!!!
